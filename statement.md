# Problem Statement
Build a browser-based, real-time computer vision demo that visualizes multiple fundamental CV operations (edges, features, segmentation, pseudo-depth) and produces AR-style overlays for demonstration and evaluation.

# Scope
- Single-device browser demo using OpenCV.js
- Visualize and compare classical CV algorithms
- Produce screenshots and report as required by VITyarthi guidelines.

# Target users
- Course instructor & evaluators
- Students learning core CV operations

# High-level features
- Real-time modes: edges, depth-like map, features, segmentation, AR overlay
- Screenshot saving for report
